Given your setup, where the Angular 17 app uses an authentication service to communicate with an Express proxy server on `localhost:7000`, which then forwards the request to a WCF service, the problem occurs when trying to access it externally. Here’s a detailed approach to resolve this:

### Key Points:
1. **Angular App**: Running on `http://localhost:4200` or similar.
2. **Express Proxy Server**: Running on `http://localhost:7000`, forwarding requests to a WCF service.
3. **WCF Service**: Receives requests via the Express proxy and returns responses.

### Problem: External devices (not on the same machine) cannot access the login service and are getting `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors.

### Possible Causes and Solutions:

---

### 1. **Express Server Binding to Localhost**
   - **Issue**: The Express server is running on `localhost`, which restricts access to the local machine only. External devices won’t be able to access the Express server because it's bound to `localhost`.
   
   - **Solution**: Update your Express server to bind to `0.0.0.0` instead of `localhost`. This will allow external access.
     ```javascript
     app.listen(7000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
       console.log('Proxy server running on port 7000');
     });
     ```

   - **Explanation**: By binding the Express server to `0.0.0.0`, you're telling it to listen on all available network interfaces, including the machine's IP address.

---

### 2. **Accessing Angular App and Express Proxy via IP**
   - **Issue**: Your Angular app likely points to `http://localhost:7000` for the backend URL. When accessed externally, this won’t work because `localhost` refers to the client machine, not the server machine.
   
   - **Solution**:
     1. Replace the `localhost` in your Angular app with the actual IP address of your machine where the Express proxy is running. This will ensure external devices can access it.
        ```typescript
        export const environment = {
          production: false,
          apiUrl: 'http://<your-server-ip>:7000'  // Replace with your server IP
        };
        ```
     2. In the Angular environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`), use the IP address of the machine running the Express server.

---

### 3. **Firewall/Port Blocking**
   - **Issue**: External devices might be blocked from accessing port 7000 by a firewall on your development machine or router.
   
   - **Solution**:
     - **Windows Firewall**: Ensure that Windows Firewall (or the firewall on your OS) allows connections on port 7000.
       1. Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.
       2. Create a new inbound rule allowing traffic on port 7000.
     - **Router/Network**: If your development machine is behind a router, configure **port forwarding** for port 7000 to allow external traffic.
     - **Testing**: Try accessing the Express server directly from an external device by using the IP address and port, e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:7000`.

### 4. **CORS Issues**
   - **Issue**: When making API requests from your Angular app to the Express server running on a different port or IP, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies may prevent the request from succeeding.
   
   - **Solution**: Ensure that CORS is enabled on your Express proxy server. You can do this by using the `cors` package in your Express server:
     ```javascript
     const cors = require('cors');
     app.use(cors({
       origin: ['http://<your-angular-ip>:4200'],  // Add your Angular app's IP here
       credentials: true // If using cookies or authorization headers
     }));
     ```

   - **Explanation**: This allows your Angular app running on a different port (like `http://localhost:4200`) to communicate with the Express server without getting blocked by CORS policies.

### 5. **Express Server Logs and Debugging**
   - **Issue**: You may not know whether the Express server is receiving the requests or if they are being blocked before reaching the server.
   
   - **Solution**:
     1. Add logging in the Express server to verify if requests from the Angular app are received:
        ```javascript
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
          console.log(`Received request: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
          next();
        });
        ```
     2. Check the Express logs to see if the requests are reaching the proxy server and if they are being forwarded to the WCF service correctly.

---

### 6. **Proxying Requests to the WCF Service**
   - **Issue**: The Express proxy server might be incorrectly forwarding the request to the WCF service or the WCF service might be unreachable from the Express server.
   
   - **Solution**: Test if the WCF service is reachable by making a direct request from the Express server using a tool like `curl` or `Postman`. If the WCF service is unreachable, this could indicate a configuration issue with the WCF service itself.

   - **Example**: Use `axios` or `http` within your Express server to make the request to the WCF service and handle the response.
     ```javascript
     const axios = require('axios');
     app.post('/api/auth', (req, res) => {
       axios.post('http://wcf-service-url/auth', req.body)
         .then(response => res.json(response.data))
         .catch(error => res.status(500).json({ error: error.message }));
     });
     ```

### 7. **SSL/TLS (if using HTTPS)**
   - **Issue**: If you're using HTTPS for your Angular app or Express server, there may be SSL/TLS certificate issues when accessing it externally.
   
   - **Solution**: If you're not using valid certificates, consider temporarily switching to HTTP for testing purposes. Ensure that SSL certificates are properly installed if HTTPS is required.

---

### 8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - **Access from an External Device**: Once the Express server is properly configured, try accessing it from another device on the same network or from a remote machine using the public IP address:
     - **Same Network**: `http://<your-server-ip>:7000`
     - **Remote Network**: If you’re testing from a remote network, make sure your router is forwarding the port (7000) to your machine and that your machine's firewall allows this access.

---

### Example Configuration Flow:
1. **Express Server**: 
   - Run on IP `0.0.0.0`, listening on port `7000`.
   - Ensure CORS is enabled to allow Angular app requests.
2. **Angular App**: 
   - In `environment.ts`, set `apiUrl` to the IP address of the machine running the Express server.
   - Update any API requests to use this IP instead of `localhost`.
3. **Test Setup**:
   - Access Angular and Express externally via `http://<your-server-ip>:4200` (Angular) and `http://<your-server-ip>:7000` (Express).

---

### Conclusion:
- Bind your Express server to `0.0.0.0`.
- Update the API URL in your Angular app to use the machine's IP instead of `localhost`.
- Ensure CORS is properly configured on the Express server.
- Allow incoming traffic on port 7000 through firewalls and routers.
- Debug by checking if the Express server receives the requests and forwards them correctly to the WCF service.
