Here’s how you can create an Express server to handle data from the Angular app and then forward it to a WCF service API.

### 1. **Setup Express Server**

First, let's set up a basic Express server. The server will accept POST requests from the Angular app, process the data, and forward it to the WCF service API.

#### Install required packages

You will need the following packages:
- `express`: To create the server.
- `axios` or `node-fetch`: To send HTTP requests to the WCF service.
- `body-parser`: To parse incoming request bodies.

```bash
npm install express body-parser axios
```

### 2. **Create Express Server**

Below is the code for the Express server that handles form data from the five tabs and forwards it to the WCF service.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const axios = require('axios'); // To call the WCF service
const app = express();

// Use body-parser middleware to parse incoming JSON data
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Endpoint to handle data submission
app.post('/submit-data', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const formData = req.body;
    
    // Assume formData contains fields from all tabs
    console.log("Received data from Angular:", formData);

    // Construct the data for the WCF service
    const wcfPayload = {
      caseNumber: formData.caseDetails.caseNumber,
      patientName: formData.caseDetails.patientName,
      totalCost: formData.costDetails.totalCost,
      insuranceCoverage: formData.costDetails.insuranceCoverage,
      diagnosis: formData.pastMedical.diagnosis,
      treatment: formData.pastMedical.treatment,
      maternityHistory: formData.maternity.maternityHistory,
      lastChildBirthDate: formData.maternity.lastChildBirthDate,
      complications: formData.maternity.complications,
      accidentalHistory: formData.accidental.accidentalHistory,
      accidentDate: formData.accidental.accidentDate,
      injuries: formData.accidental.injuries,
    };

    // Example WCF service endpoint URL
    const wcfServiceUrl = 'http://wcf-service-url.com/api/submit';

    // Send data to the WCF service using Axios
    const wcfResponse = await axios.post(wcfServiceUrl, wcfPayload, {
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });

    // Log and send back response
    console.log("Response from WCF Service:", wcfResponse.data);
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Data submitted successfully', response: wcfResponse.data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error submitting data to WCF Service:", error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to submit data', error: error.message });
  }
});

// Start the Express server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### 3. **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Express Setup:**
   - We import the necessary modules: `express` for the server, `body-parser` for parsing JSON payloads, and `axios` for making HTTP requests to the WCF service.
   - The `body-parser` middleware is used to automatically parse the incoming JSON payload.

2. **POST Endpoint (`/submit-data`):**
   - The endpoint listens for POST requests from the Angular app. The incoming request body (which contains the form data) is parsed and logged.
   - We then structure the data (`wcfPayload`) to match what the WCF service expects. This includes fields from the five tabs (case details, cost details, past medical, maternity, and accidental forms).
   
3. **Calling WCF Service:**
   - We use `axios.post()` to send a POST request to the WCF service API. The WCF endpoint URL and headers are configured in the request.
   - The payload for the WCF service is a JSON object constructed from the received form data.

4. **Error Handling:**
   - The server catches and logs any errors that occur during the request to the WCF service. If the request fails, it responds with a 500 status code and an error message. Otherwise, it sends a success response back to the Angular app with the WCF service’s response.

### 4. **Handling Different Tabs in Angular**

When submitting data from the Angular app, you would gather data from all five tabs, merge it into a single object, and send it to this Express server. Here's a quick overview of how the Angular submission might look:

#### Angular Service to Send Data

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class SubmissionService {
  private apiUrl = 'http://localhost:3000/submit-data';

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  submitFormData(formData: any): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.post(this.apiUrl, formData);
  }
}
```

#### Angular Component to Submit Data

```typescript
export class FormComponent {
  constructor(private submissionService: SubmissionService) {}

  onSubmitAllTabs() {
    const allFormData = {
      caseDetails: this.caseDetailsForm.value,
      costDetails: this.costDetailsForm.value,
      pastMedical: this.pastMedicalForm.value,
      maternity: this.maternityForm.value,
      accidental: this.accidentalForm.value,
    };

    this.submissionService.submitFormData(allFormData).subscribe(
      (response) => {
        console.log("Data submitted successfully:", response);
      },
      (error) => {
        console.error("Error submitting data:", error);
      }
    );
  }
}
```

### 5. **WCF Service API**

Assuming the WCF service API is set up to accept JSON, it should process the incoming data accordingly. Ensure that the WCF service endpoint matches the structure of the JSON being sent by the Express server.

If the WCF service only accepts XML, you will need to serialize the JSON data into XML before sending it from Express. This can be done using packages like `xml2js` or similar.
