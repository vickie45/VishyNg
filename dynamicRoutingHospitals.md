To implement this dynamic navigation based on the result of your authentication API in Angular, here's a high-level approach:

1. **Call the Authentication API:**
   After a successful login, call the API to fetch the hospitals associated with the user.

2. **Check the Hospital Array:**
   When the API response comes back, check the length of the hospital array:
   - If the array contains more than one hospital, navigate to the "Select Hospital" page where the user can choose a hospital.
   - If the array contains only one hospital, navigate directly to the dashboard of that hospital.

Here is an example of how you might implement this:

### Example Code
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service'; // Assuming this is your service

@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  templateUrl: './login.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./login.component.css']
})
export class LoginComponent {

  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  onLogin(credentials: any) {
    this.authService.login(credentials).subscribe(
      (response) => {
        // Call the auth API to get hospitals
        this.authService.getUserHospitals(response.userId).subscribe(
          (hospitals: any[]) => {
            if (hospitals.length > 1) {
              // Navigate to hospital select page
              this.router.navigate(['/select-hospital']);
            } else if (hospitals.length === 1) {
              // Navigate directly to the dashboard with hospital ID
              this.router.navigate(['/dashboard', hospitals[0].id]);
            }
          },
          (error) => {
            // Handle error
            console.error("Failed to fetch hospitals", error);
          }
        );
      },
      (error) => {
        // Handle login error
        console.error("Login failed", error);
      }
    );
  }
}
```

### Key Parts of the Implementation:
1. **Login Request:**
   - The `authService.login()` method is responsible for handling the login and fetching the `userId` or other needed details.

2. **Fetching Hospitals:**
   - The `authService.getUserHospitals()` method fetches the list of hospitals associated with the user.

3. **Routing Logic:**
   - If the user is associated with more than one hospital, the user is redirected to the hospital selection page (`/select-hospital`).
   - If the user has only one associated hospital, they are redirected to the hospital's dashboard directly with the hospital ID (`/dashboard/{hospitalId}`).

You can adjust this based on your actual routing and service implementation.

### Auth Service Example
You would need to define your `AuthService` with the relevant API calls:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthService {

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) { }

  login(credentials: any): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.post('/api/login', credentials);
  }

  getUserHospitals(userId: string): Observable<any[]> {
    return this.http.get<any[]>(`/api/user/${userId}/hospitals`);
  }
}
```

This is a simple approach to dynamic navigation based on the API response. Adjust it based on your specific project needs.
