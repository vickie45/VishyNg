Handling merge conflicts in Git can be straightforward once you understand the steps involved. Here’s a detailed guide on how to identify, resolve, and complete the merge when conflicts arise.

### 1. **Understand the Merge Conflict**
A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two branches you are trying to merge. This usually happens when the same line of a file has been changed differently in each branch.

### 2. **Attempt to Merge**
When you try to merge two branches, if there are conflicts, Git will indicate this in the terminal:

```bash
git merge <branch_name>
```

If there are conflicts, Git will output something like:

```plaintext
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file_name>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

### 3. **Check the Status**
Run the following command to see which files have conflicts:

```bash
git status
```

This will show you the files that need attention, marked as "unmerged paths."

### 4. **Open the Conflicted Files**
Open the files that have conflicts. You’ll see sections marked by Git:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Changes made in the current branch.
=======
Changes made in the branch being merged.
>>>>>>> <branch_name>
```

- The section between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` shows changes from your current branch.
- The section between `=======` and `>>>>>>> <branch_name>` shows changes from the branch being merged.

### 5. **Resolve the Conflicts**
You need to decide how to resolve the conflict:

- **Choose One Change**: Keep either the current branch’s change or the incoming branch’s change.
- **Combine Changes**: Merge the changes manually if both sets of changes are needed.

Edit the file to reflect your resolution, and then save the changes.

### 6. **Mark the Conflicts as Resolved**
After resolving conflicts in the files, you need to stage them:

```bash
git add <file_name>
```

Repeat this for each file with conflicts.

### 7. **Complete the Merge**
Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, complete the merge by committing the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
```

### 8. **Push the Changes (If Needed)**
If you are working with a remote repository, don’t forget to push your changes:

```bash
git push origin <branch_name>
```

### Example Workflow
Here’s a summarized workflow for handling merge conflicts:

1. Attempt to merge branches:

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

2. Check the status to see conflicted files:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Open and edit the conflicting files, resolving the conflicts:

4. Stage the resolved files:

   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_file>
   ```

5. Commit the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```

6. Push the changes to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Using Merge Tools
If you prefer a graphical interface or need more advanced conflict resolution, consider using a merge tool. You can set one up (e.g., KDiff3, Meld, Beyond Compare) and run:

```bash
git mergetool
```

This command will open the specified merge tool for each conflicting file, making it easier to resolve conflicts visually.

### Summary
- **Identify**: Understand what files are conflicting.
- **Resolve**: Edit the conflicting sections to merge changes manually.
- **Stage**: Add the resolved files to the staging area.
- **Commit**: Complete the merge and push if necessary.

To merge the `Feature_Room_Tarrif` branch into the `feature_memsearch` branch using Git, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Checkout the Target Branch (`feature_memsearch`)**:
   Start by switching to the branch you want to merge changes into (`feature_memsearch`).

   ```bash
   git checkout feature_memsearch
   ```

2. **Merge the Source Branch (`Feature_Room_Tarrif`)**:
   Now, merge the `Feature_Room_Tarrif` branch into `feature_memsearch`.

   ```bash
   git merge Feature_Room_Tarrif
   ```

3. **Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Any)**:
   - If there are any conflicts during the merge, Git will notify you.
   - Open the conflicted files, resolve the differences, and then mark the conflicts as resolved by staging the files.
   
   ```bash
   git add <conflicted_file>
   ```

4. **Complete the Merge**:
   Once the conflicts (if any) are resolved, commit the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Merged Feature_Room_Tarrif into feature_memsearch"
   ```

5. **Push the Changes (If Required)**:
   If you're working with a remote repository, push the merged changes to the remote:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature_memsearch
   ```

### Summary of Commands:
```bash
git checkout feature_memsearch
git merge Feature_Room_Tarrif
# Resolve conflicts if there are any
git add <file_with_conflict>
git commit -m "Merged Feature_Room_Tarrif into feature_memsearch"
git push origin feature_memsearch
```
