Got it! Let’s rewrite the TDD summary in a more human, approachable, and easy-to-read style while still being technically accurate. I’ll focus on explaining things as if you were walking a new developer through the module, including what it does, how it works, and where you’d typically touch the code.

Program Integrity Module – Developer-Friendly Summary

Module Name: Program Integrity Module
Purpose: This module helps keep unemployment insurance claims honest. It allows you to search claim data, flag suspicious claims, manage SARs (Suspected Activity Reports), and keep a full audit trail of all actions.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Custom Framework)

Backend: .NET Core Microservices

Events: Kafka

Caching: Redis

Database: PostgreSQL

Batch Jobs: Scheduled analysis for fraud detection

Cloud: AWS (ECS/EKS/EC2, CloudWatch, RDS)

Development / CI-CD: Azure DevOps



---

1. The Core Microservices – What They Do and Where You Work

1. IDH Search Service

Lets users search claims in the IDH Integrity Data Hub.

Uses Redis to cache results so searches are fast.

Where you might change things: Add new search filters, tweak cache settings, integrate new ICDH APIs.



2. SAR Management Service

Handles everything about SARs: creating, updating, fetching, and publishing events to Kafka.

Logs all actions in the Audit Service.

Where you might change things: Add new fields to SARs, change validation rules, modify Kafka payloads.



3. Batch Job Service

Runs scheduled jobs to automatically detect suspicious claims and generate SARs.

Uses rules or ML models to flag anomalies.

Where you might change things: Update anomaly detection logic, change batch schedules, or trigger extra notifications.



4. Audit & Logging Service

Tracks every action: searches, SAR creation, updates, and batch runs.

Stores logs in PostgreSQL and sends them to AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.

Where you might change things: Add new event types, extend logs, or adjust formatting for reports.



5. Frontend (React Custom Framework)

Includes the IDH Search Page, SAR Dashboard, and SAR Creation Modal.

Where you might change things: Add new filters, pagination, extra fields, validation, or improved UI/UX.

2. Key Tables in PostgreSQL

1. SAR_Records – Stores all SARs

Columns: SarId, ClaimId, ClaimantName, Reason, Severity, Status, CreatedBy, CreatedAt

Changes here usually involve adding new fields or updating the structure to support new UI/UX features.



2. Audit_Logs – Tracks all actions

Columns: AuditId, Entity, Action, UserId, Timestamp, Details

You might extend it to capture new event types or extra metadata.



3. Claims – Holds claim data for batch jobs (optional)

Columns: ClaimId, ClaimantName, ClaimAmount, ClaimStatus

Updates might happen when new anomaly detection rules require extra claim data.



4. Batch_Job_Logs – Tracks batch execution

Columns: JobId, JobName, RunTime, Status, Details

3. How It Works – Step by Step

3.1 Searching Claims (IDH Search)

You type in search filters in the frontend.

The frontend calls the IDH Search Service.

The service checks Redis first:

If results are cached → fast return.

If not → calls the IDH API, caches results, then returns data.


Results appear in the frontend table.

Your code changes: Add new search filters, tweak caching, integrate extra APIs.



---

3.2 Creating a SAR (Manual)

You identify a suspicious claim → open the SAR Modal → submit.

The SAR Management Service validates and stores it in SAR_Records.

A SAR_Created event is sent to Kafka.

Audit service logs the action.

Your code changes: Add fields, tweak validation, adjust Kafka payload, maybe update the modal in React.



---

3.3 Creating a SAR (Automated Batch)

The Batch Job Service runs nightly.

It fetches claims, checks for anomalies, and creates SARs automatically.

Publishes SAR_BatchAlert events to Kafka.

Audit service logs everything.

Your code changes: Update batch rules, tweak anomaly detection, schedule changes, or add notifications.



---

3.4 Viewing & Updating SARs

Users go to the SAR Dashboard → frontend calls backend → fetches SARs.

Users can view details, update status, or export.

Updates trigger Kafka events and audit logs.

Your code changes: Frontend enhancements (filters, table, modal), new status values, backend logic for updates.



---

3.5 Audit & Kafka

Every action is logged in Audit_Logs and monitored via CloudWatch.

Kafka events propagate changes to dashboards, notifications, or analytics.

Your code changes: Add new events, modify schemas, or add new consumers for Kafka.



---

3.6 Error Handling

IDH API fails → retry logic in service.

Database failures → transaction rollback.

Kafka downtime → retry queue.

Validation errors → frontend displays messages.



---

4. How You Think About It

IDH Search Service: “This is where users start; performance matters.”

SAR Management Service: “This is the core; everything about suspicious claims goes here.”

Batch Job Service: “Automates fraud detection; rules or ML models run here.”

Audit Service: “Never let anything go unlogged; compliance depends on this.”

Frontend: “All user interactions happen here; must match backend logic.”

Code changes mostly happen in service classes (*.cs), controllers, Kafka producers, and React components (*.jsx).

Database changes require migrations and updating repository/service logic.

This version is more “human”: it reads like a walkthrough, explains the why/how, and ties it to where you work in the codebase.

If you want, I can now make a single text-based diagram that shows the microservices, database tables, batch jobs, Kafka events, and frontend flow all in one picture—using the same names you’ve been using. This will make it super easy to visualize your entire module.

Do you want me to make that?
