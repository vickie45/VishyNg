If both branches exist on the remote, here’s the step-by-step process to merge them locally and push the changes back to the remote:

1. Fetch the Latest Changes

Sync your local repository with the remote to ensure you have the latest versions of both branches.

git fetch origin

2. Check Out the Target Branch

Switch to the branch you want to merge into. For example, if you’re merging feature into main:

git checkout main

3. Merge the Source Branch

Merge the source branch (e.g., feature) into the current branch (e.g., main):

git merge origin/feature

If there are no conflicts, Git will complete the merge. If conflicts arise:

	1.	Resolve the conflicts in your files.
	2.	Mark the conflicts as resolved:

git add <file>


	3.	Complete the merge:

git commit



4. Push the Changes to the Remote

After merging, push the updated branch to the remote repository:

git push origin main

Scenario

	•	If you’re merging develop into main:
	1.	Fetch the remote branches:

git fetch origin


	2.	Check out main:

git checkout main


	3.	Merge develop:

git merge origin/develop


	4.	Push the updated main branch:

git push origin main



This ensures your local merge is reflected on the remote repository.
