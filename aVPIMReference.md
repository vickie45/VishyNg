Technical Design Document (TDD)

Project: Unemployment Insurance Portal – Program Integrity Module
Module: Program Integrity (IDH Search, Integrity Data Hub, SAR Management)
Tech Stack: React (custom framework), .NET Core Microservices, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Batch Jobs, AWS CloudWatch & AWS Platform, Azure DevOps

Prepared By: Vignesh Selvakumar Nadar
Date: 07-Oct-2025

1. Overview

The Program Integrity Module ensures detection, investigation, and reporting of potentially fraudulent unemployment insurance claims. This module integrates:

1. IDH Search: Querying the Integrated Data Hub for claimant-related information.


2. IDH Integrity Data Hub Search Results: Displaying search results for verification.


3. SAR Records: Creation, management, and viewing of Suspected Activity Reports (SAR) based on findings.



The system ensures real-time data integrity, auditability, and seamless integration with the existing Unemployment Insurance Portal.


---

2. Functional Requirements

2.1 IDH Search

Search claimant information via IDH using:

SSN / UHID

Name / Date of Birth

Claim ID


Support advanced search filters (date ranges, claim types, regions).

Display search results with summary and detailed data from IDH.


2.2 Integrity Data Hub Search Results

List matching claims from IDH.

Highlight suspicious activity or anomalies based on predefined rules.

Provide action buttons:

Create SAR

View Claim Details

Flag / Mark for further review



2.3 SAR Records Management

Create SAR Records: Capture details of suspicious activity.

Fields: SAR ID, claimant details, reason, severity, linked claim IDs, timestamp.

Persist records in PostgreSQL.

Publish SAR events to Kafka for downstream processing.


View SAR Records:

Filter by date, status, claimant, or severity.

Support pagination, sorting, and export.

Audit trail maintained for every action.

---

4. Database Design

4.1 PostgreSQL – SAR Records

Table: SAR_Records

Column Name	Type	Description

sar_id	UUID (PK)	Unique SAR ID
claim_id	VARCHAR(50)	Linked claim ID(s)

created_at	TIMESTAMP	Record creation time
updated_by	VARCHAR(100)	Last user who updated SAR
updated_at	TIMESTAMP	Last update timestamp


Indexes:

IDX_SAR_ClaimID → for quick search by claim ID

IDX_SAR_Status → for filtering by status

IDX_SAR_CreatedAt → for date-based searches



---

5. API Design

GET /api/idh/search
Query Params: ssn, claimId, name, dob, region
Response: [
  {
    claimId,
    claimantName,
    dob,
    anomaliesDetected,
    linkedSARs: [sar_id1, sar_id2],
    detailsUrl
  }
]

5.2 SAR Management API

POST /api/sar
Body: { claimId, claimantName, claimantSSN, reason, severity }
Response: { sarId, status }

GET /api/sar
Query Params: claimId, status, dateFrom, dateTo, severity

If you want, I can also draw a detailed Architecture Diagram and Data Flow Diagram showing how IDH search, SAR creation, batch jobs, Kafka events, and frontend UI interact, which will make this TDD fully visual and developer-ready.

Do you want me to create that diagram next?

Absolutely. I’ll create text-based architecture and data flow diagrams for your Program Integrity Module using ASCII-style diagrams for clarity. This will cover IDH search, SAR creation, batch jobs, Kafka events, Redis caching, PostgreSQL, and frontend interaction.

These diagrams cover the frontend → microservices → database → Kafka → batch jobs → monitoring interactions.

If you want, I can also create a combined “end-to-end sequence diagram” showing user search → SAR creation → batch processing → event propagation for easier reference by developers and architects.

Do you want me to create that sequence diagram next?

Perfect. Here’s a text-based end-to-end sequence diagram for your Program Integrity Module, covering user search → SAR creation → batch processing → Kafka events → audit/logging → frontend updates. I’ve used ASCII-style formatting for clarity.

---

Legend / Notes:

1. User → React Frontend: User performs IDH search or SAR creation.


2. React Frontend → API Gateway/BFF: All frontend requests go through API Gateway.


3. IDH Search Service: Checks Redis cache first; queries external IDH API if needed.


4. SAR Service: Persists SAR in PostgreSQL, emits SAR_Created event to Kafka, and logs action to Audit & Logging.


5. Batch Job Service: Scheduled to analyze claims, can auto-create SARs if anomalies are detected.


6. Kafka: Event-driven communication; other services (notifications, dashboards, analytics) consume SAR events.


7. Audit & Logging: Central logging for all user actions, batch jobs, and SAR operations.


8. PostgreSQL: Main persistence for SAR records and audit trails.

If you want, I can also create a combined “module interaction diagram” in text showing all services, events, and dependencies in one visual map, which will serve as a complete reference for developers and architects.

Do you want me to create that next?

Absolutely. I’ll create a comprehensive end-to-end text-based design that covers all use case scenarios for your Program Integrity Module, including:

IDH Search (normal and advanced)

SAR creation (manual and batch)

SAR viewing and updates

Batch job anomaly detection

Kafka event propagation

Audit trail and logging

Error handling and retries


I’ll structure it in a text-based interaction and flow diagram format, covering all flows developers need to implement.

If you want, I can now create a single “combined module interaction diagram” in text that visually maps all services, flows, events, batch jobs, and frontend interactions in one reference chart—very useful for developers and architects.

Do you want me to do that next?

Absolutely. I’ll provide a comprehensive explanation of the Program Integrity Module for your Unemployment Insurance Portal, covering all components, their working, interactions, and purpose in a detailed, step-by-step manner. This will give you a full understanding of the module, both from a functional and technical perspective.


---

Program Integrity Module – Working Explanation

The Program Integrity Module ensures that unemployment insurance claims are valid, detects potentially fraudulent activity, and maintains an audit trail for compliance. It consists of IDH search, SAR management, batch processing, Kafka events, Redis caching, PostgreSQL persistence, React frontend, AWS deployment, and audit/logging services.


---

1. IDH Search

Purpose:
To allow administrators and auditors to verify claimant data against the Integrated Data Hub (IDH).

Working:

1. User Interaction:

A user enters search parameters (SSN, Claim ID, Name, DOB, etc.) on the frontend.

Advanced search supports filters such as claim type, region, and date range.



2. Frontend → Backend:

React frontend sends a request to the API Gateway or Backend-for-Frontend (BFF).



3. Caching:

The IDH Search Service first checks Redis to see if the search results for the same parameters already exist.

If cached, results are returned immediately for faster response.

If not cached, it queries the IDH external API, stores the results in Redis, and returns the data.



4. Display:

The frontend displays the search results in a table with summary data, anomalies detected, and actions (e.g., Create SAR, View Details).




Error Handling:

If IDH API fails or times out, retries occur (up to 2 attempts).

If unsuccessful, a user-friendly error is shown.



---

2. SAR (Suspected Activity Report) Management

2.1 Manual SAR Creation

Purpose:
To document potentially fraudulent claims identified during IDH search or other investigations.

Working:

1. User Action:

After reviewing search results, the user clicks “Create SAR.”



2. Backend Processing:

The SAR Management Service validates the input.

A new SAR record is persisted in PostgreSQL, including:

SAR ID, linked claim ID, claimant details, reason, severity, status, timestamps, created_by.




3. Event Publishing:

Once created, a SAR_Created event is published to Kafka, so downstream services (notification, reporting dashboards) are aware of the new SAR.



4. Audit Logging:

Every SAR creation is logged in Audit & Logging Service, which persists the log in PostgreSQL and streams to AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.



5. Confirmation:

Frontend receives a confirmation that SAR creation was successful.




Variants / Features:

Update SAR status (Open → In Review → Closed).

Edit reason or severity.

Duplicate SAR prevention.



---

2.2 Batch / Automated SAR Creation

Purpose:
To automatically detect anomalies in claims using predefined rules or ML scoring.

Working:

1. Scheduled Batch Job:

Runs nightly or weekly via the Batch Job Service.

Fetches recent claims and existing SARs from PostgreSQL.



2. Analysis:

Applies anomaly detection logic (rules: e.g., multiple claims from same SSN, unusual claim amounts).

Can include ML models for predicting fraud likelihood.



3. SAR Creation:

Suspicious claims automatically generate SARs in PostgreSQL.

Events are published to Kafka (SAR_BatchAlert).

Audit logs are updated for compliance.



4. Approval (Optional):

High severity SARs may require manual review before finalization.




Error Handling:

Database locks or Kafka unavailability triggers retries.

Batch job failures are logged and monitored in CloudWatch.



---

3. SAR Viewing and Update

Purpose:
To review, manage, and update SAR records efficiently.

Working:

1. Listing SARs:

Users access the SAR Management Page in React.

Requests are sent to GET /api/sar with optional filters (status, severity, date range).

Backend fetches records from PostgreSQL, applies pagination, and returns data to frontend.



2. Viewing Details:

Clicking a SAR displays detailed information, including linked claims and audit trail.



3. Updating SARs:

Status or details can be updated (PUT /api/sar/{id}) by authorized users.

Updates persist in PostgreSQL, trigger Kafka events (SAR_Updated), and log actions in Audit Service.




Features:

Pagination, sorting, filtering

Export to CSV/PDF

Role-based access control



---

4. Kafka Event Propagation

Purpose:
Event-driven communication for real-time updates and notifications.

Working:

Events: SAR_Created, SAR_Updated, SAR_BatchAlert

Producers: SAR Management Service, Batch Job Service

Consumers: Notification Service (emails/SMS), Analytics & Reporting Dashboard, external audit tools

Benefits: Loose coupling, asynchronous processing, real-time updates



---

5. Redis Caching

Purpose:
To reduce latency and load on IDH API and database queries.

Working:

IDH Search Service first queries Redis for cached search results.

If present, returns immediately (Cache Hit).

If absent, queries IDH API, caches the results for future requests (Cache Miss).


Features:

TTL (time-to-live) for cache entries

Eviction policies to manage memory



---

6. PostgreSQL Database

Purpose:
Persistent storage for SAR records, batch job logs, and audit trails.

Key Tables:

1. SAR_Records – Stores SAR ID, claim ID, claimant info, reason, severity, status, timestamps.


2. Audit_Logs – Tracks all actions (search, SAR creation/update, batch processing).



Indexes:

On claim ID, status, created_at for fast searches and filtering.



---

7. Audit & Logging

Purpose:
Compliance, traceability, and monitoring.

Working:

All frontend and backend actions (search, SAR creation, updates, batch jobs) are logged.

Logs are persisted in PostgreSQL and streamed to AWS CloudWatch.

Supports reporting, monitoring, and investigations.



---

8. Error Handling

IDH API Errors: Retry up to 2 times; fallback to user-friendly message.

Database Failures: Transaction rollback; batch retries.

Kafka Unavailability: Persist event for retry; log error.

Validation Failures: Frontend displays immediate feedback.



---

9. AWS Platform Deployment

Services: Microservices deployed on ECS/EKS or EC2 instances.

Database: PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS.

Logging & Monitoring: CloudWatch monitors service health, batch jobs, and errors.

Secrets & Config: AWS Parameter Store or Secrets Manager for secure configuration.



---

10. Frontend React Custom Framework

Pages:

IDH Search

SAR Management (List, Detail, Update)

SAR Creation Modal


Features:

Responsive tables, pagination, sorting, filtering

Role-based UI elements

API integration with BFF/Backend




---

11. End-to-End Flow Summary

1. User searches claim → frontend → IDH service → Redis caching → API → frontend


2. User identifies suspicious claim → creates SAR → SAR service → PostgreSQL → Kafka → Audit Logging → confirmation


3. Batch job analyzes claims → creates SAR automatically → Kafka event → Audit logs


4. SAR can be viewed, updated, or exported → changes trigger Kafka and logging


5. All errors handled with retries and logging; monitoring via CloudWatch




---

This setup ensures:

Real-time fraud detection

Auditability & compliance

Scalability and reliability with Kafka, Redis, and microservices

Efficient frontend UX with search, filtering, and SAR management



---

If you want, I can now create a single “mega text diagram” that maps all components, flows, services, batch jobs, Kafka events, Redis caching, PostgreSQL, and frontend interactions in one reference chart, which will make this TDD fully visual for developers and architects.

Do you want me to create that next?
